This project demonstrates fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis. It involves:

Setting up the environment: Installing necessary libraries like transformers, datasets, torch, and pandas.
Loading the model and tokenizer: Loading the google-bert/bert-base-uncased model for sequence classification and its corresponding tokenizer.
Implementing sentiment analysis: Defining a function to predict the sentiment of a given text using the loaded model and tokenizer.
Testing the function: Applying the sentiment analysis function to a batch of sample tweets.
Loading and preparing a dataset: Loading the mteb/tweet_sentiment_extraction dataset and tokenizing it for training and evaluation.
Training the model: Setting up training arguments and using the Trainer API from the transformers library to fine-tune the BERT model on the prepared dataset.
Saving and loading the fine-tuned model: Saving the trained model and tokenizer and then loading them back to demonstrate their usage after fine-tuning.
Evaluating the fine-tuned model: Applying the fine-tuned model to the same batch of sample tweets to observe the difference in predictions after training.
