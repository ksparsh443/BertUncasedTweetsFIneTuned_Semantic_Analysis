Got it 👍 Since it’s just a **Google Colab notebook project**, the README should be short, clean, and focused on what the notebook does and how to run it. Here’s an enhanced version tailored for that:

# Sentiment Analysis with Fine-Tuned BERT

This project demonstrates how to **fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model** for sentiment analysis on tweets using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It leverages the Hugging Face 🤗 **Transformers** library and PyTorch.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

The notebook walks through:

1. **Environment Setup** – Installing required libraries (`transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`, `pandas`).
2. **Loading Pre-trained Model** – Using `bert-base-uncased` and its tokenizer.
3. **Quick Inference** – Predicting sentiment of sample tweets before training.
4. **Dataset Preparation** – Using [mteb/tweet\_sentiment\_extraction](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/tweet_sentiment_extraction).
5. **Fine-Tuning** – Training BERT with Hugging Face’s `Trainer` API.
6. **Model Saving & Reloading** – Storing and reusing the fine-tuned model.
7. **Evaluation** – Comparing predictions before and after fine-tuning.

Run all cells step by step to:

* Install dependencies
* Load the pre-trained BERT
* Train on the tweet sentiment dataset
* Test predictions before & after fine-tuning

## 📊 Example Output

```python
Text: "AI is shaping the future in unexpected ways"
Prediction (Fine-tuned BERT): Positive 
```

## 🔮 Next Steps

* Extend to multi-class sentiment classification
* Try lightweight models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa) for faster training
* Deploy via Gradio/Streamlit for interactive demos

Do you also want me to make a **short badge-style header (like Colab, Hugging Face, PyTorch icons with links)** for the top of the README? It makes it look super professional on GitHub.
